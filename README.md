# MS-Scripts

### A collection of scripts for use with Microsoft Office
---------------------------------------------------------

MS-Scripts is a repoistory for Microsoft Office scripts for any purpose within any application. They are not language-specific and can be written in VBA Visual Basic or TS Typescript.

There is currently one script uploaded, for use with accounting in Microsoft Excel.

It may be more efficient to manually copy-paste the contents of the scripts into the application's code editor as opposed to copying the file itself. Keep in mind that some scripts may require some level of setup to function in your context.
